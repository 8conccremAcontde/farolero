## Step 1: Install Trapcode Psunami 14
 
To use Trapcode Psunami 14, you need to have Adobe After Effects CC 2014 or later installed on your computer. You also need to download and install the Trapcode Suite 14 from Red Giant's website[^1^]. The Trapcode Suite 14 includes other plugins such as Particular 3, Form 3, Tao 1.2, and more that can enhance your motion graphics and visual effects. Once you have installed the Trapcode Suite 14, you can find Trapcode Psunami under the Effect menu in After Effects.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Composition
 
To start creating your water scene, you need to create a new composition in After Effects. Go to Composition > New Composition and set the parameters according to your preferences. For this example, we will use a 1920 x 1080 resolution, a frame rate of 30 fps, and a duration of 10 seconds. Name your composition "Water Scene" and click OK.
 
## Step 3: Add a Solid Layer
 
Next, you need to add a solid layer to your composition. This layer will serve as the base for your water surface. Go to Layer > New > Solid and choose a dark blue color for the solid. Name it "Water" and click OK.
 
## Step 4: Apply Trapcode Psunami
 
Now you can apply Trapcode Psunami to your solid layer. Go to Effect > Red Giant > Trapcode Psunami and you will see a preview of the water surface in the Effect Controls panel. You can also see the water surface in your composition window if you switch the view mode from Active Camera to Custom View 1 or Custom View 2.
 
## Step 5: Adjust the Water Parameters
 
Trapcode Psunami has many parameters that you can adjust to customize your water surface. You can find them under four main categories: Geometry, Wave Modeler, Shading, and Environment. Here are some of the parameters that you can tweak:
 
- **Geometry:** This category controls the size, position, rotation, and perspective of the water surface. You can adjust the Scale parameter to change the size of the water surface relative to the camera. You can also adjust the Offset parameters to move the water surface along the X, Y, and Z axes. You can also adjust the Rotate parameters to rotate the water surface around the X, Y, and Z axes. You can also adjust the Camera Position parameters to change the angle and distance of the camera from the water surface.
- **Wave Modeler:** This category controls the shape, speed, direction, and variation of the waves on the water surface. You can adjust the Wind Speed parameter to change how fast the waves move across the water surface. You can also adjust the Wind Direction parameter to change the angle of the wind relative to the water surface. You can also adjust the Wave Height parameter to change how high or low the waves are on the water surface. You can also adjust the Wave Peaking parameter to change how sharp or smooth the peaks and troughs of the waves are on the water surface.
- **Shading:** This category controls the color, lighting, and reflection of
the water surface. You can adjust the Water Color parameter to change
the base color of the water surface. You can also adjust
the Specular Color parameter to change
the color of
the highlights on
the water surface.
You can also adjust
the Specular Shininess parameter
to change
how bright or dim
the highlights are on
the water surface.
You can also adjust
the Reflection Strength 0f148eb4a0
